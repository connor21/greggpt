# Sample Test Document

This document contains sample content for testing the gregGPT system.

## Python Basics

Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its readability and simplicity. Key features include:

- Dynamic typing
- Automatic memory management
- Extensive standard library
- Support for multiple programming paradigms

```python
def hello_world():
    print("Hello, World!")
```

## Vector Databases

Vector databases like ChromaDB are specialized for storing and querying vector embeddings. Common use cases include:

1. Semantic search
2. Recommendation systems
3. Anomaly detection

### Key Features

- Efficient nearest neighbor search
- Support for various distance metrics (cosine, Euclidean, etc.)
- Horizontal scalability

## Testing Strategies

When testing a RAG pipeline, consider:

- **Unit tests**: Individual components (retriever, model, etc.)
- **Integration tests**: Full pipeline from query to response
- **Performance tests**: Latency and throughput measurements

> "Testing leads to failure, and failure leads to understanding." - Burt Rutan

## Sample Queries

Here are some test queries you can use:

- What are the key features of Python?
- How do vector databases work?
- What testing approaches are recommended for RAG systems?
- Explain the hello_world function in the code example
